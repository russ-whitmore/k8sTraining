## Debug with temp pods 

Debug with busybox 

Pod network is different from cluster node network
    Execute troubleshooting commands from within a pod 

    Common images with unix utilities 
        busybox is an example 
            doesn't have curl available 

Create pod with busybox image 

    kubectl run debug-pod --image=busybox 
    kubectl get pod 
    not running - status is completed
    another restart - the pod is there but there's no container running inside 
    kubectl exec -it debug-pod -- sh (won't work, container not found)

Containers are meant to exec a specific task 
    Container exits once task is done 


Where do you see what process a container starts?
    Container lives as long as process inside lives 
    Looking a dockerfile on nginx image 
    CMD in dockerfile 

How do we keep busybox pod alive?

    1. Start with interactive mode (-it)
        a. kubectl run debug-pod-2 --image=busybox -it (now inside busybox terminal)
            exit 
            will now be in a running state 
    kubectl delete pod debug-pod debug-pod-2 

    2. Define "command" and "args" in Configuration file
         docker run <image name> <command> overwrites the CMD instruction 
         not overwrite - but pass parameter 
    
    Entrypoint defines the process that starts in a container 

How does this map to k8s?
    vim bb-pod.yaml 
    copy and paste pod image yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: busybox-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox-container 
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 1000"] - how to override commands in the docker image
    save and quit 

Execute commands inside the pod 

    kubectl exec -it busybox-pod -- sh 
    ping without interactive terminal
    Pass in the command  
    kubectl exec -it busybox-pod -- bash (if that gives you an error, it means image doesn't have bash exe inside)
    Need to fallback to shell 
    kubectl exec -it busybox-pod -- sh -c "printenv"
    Can also do expressions 
    kubectl exec -it busybox-pod -- sh -c "netstat -lntp"
