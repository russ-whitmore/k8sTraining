## Troubleshoot kubelet and kubectl issues 

kubectl get node - we see worker1 is not ready
how can we debug?
usually indicates kubelet process is a problem on that node 
ssh into worker1 and troubleshoot kubelet 

check kubelet status 
    service kubelet status 
    (is in activated status, see failure that shows no file or directory)
    check file path to validate 
    find where kubelet exec binary is located 
    which kubelet 
    sudo cat /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    shows config that starts kubelet 
    wrong path in execstart entry - change path and save 
    need to restart kubelet service so it can read changed config 
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
    sudo systemctl restart kubelet 
    service kubelet status 
    kubectl get node 

Troubleshoot kubectl connection issue 
    kubectl commands stop working 
    either an error or the command hangs 

    kubectl is defined in kube config file - cat ~/.kube/config to validate everything is correct 
    validate that certificate is correct 
    copy cert data - echo paste | base64 --decode 
    check that it's the same the cluster is using 
    sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt - this looks correct 
    check if endpoint is correct 
    we know it's running on master node in port 6443 - validate master node ip address is correct
    check in console, - looks different than in master node. 
    can also verify in /etc/hosts file 
    vim ~/.kube/config 
    paste correct IP address of master node 
    kubectl get node 
    kubectl cluster-info
