## Sidecar and init containers 

You can have multiple containers inside the pod 
Main and helper app 
Helper app - sidecar 
    Usually operates asynchronously 
    Can talk to each other using localhost 
    Can share data 
    can have multiple sidecar containers in a pod 

Init container 
    env prep: set env variables, test environment etc. Different from sidecar  
    sidecar containers run the entire time, not just at the start 
    Sidecars start as the same time as the main container 
    Init containers run once in the beginning and exits 
    Main container starts afterwards 
    Used to initialize something 
    Add init section in pod config - k8s will know to start it first
