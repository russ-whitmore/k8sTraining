## What are resource requests and limits?


Configure resource requests for each container
    Requests is what the container is guaranteed to get 
    K8s scheduler users this to figure out where to run the pods 

Why resource limits are important?
    What is application needs more resources?
        Too much data to load into memory 
        Bug in application 
        Container will consume more than the requested resources 
        If not limited, container could consume all resources 

Configure resource limits for each container 
    Make sure container never goes above a certain value 
    Container is only allowed to go up to the limit
