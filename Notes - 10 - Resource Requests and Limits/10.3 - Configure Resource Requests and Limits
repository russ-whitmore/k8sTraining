## Configure resource requests and limits

How much resources will your application need?

This is done in the deployment yaml 

under container definition 
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "64Mi"
        cpu: "250m"
      limits:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500Mi"

Querying defined Resources and Limits 
    Which pods have resource requests and limits set?
    kubectl get pod -o jsonpath="{range .items[*]} {.metadata.name}{.spec.containers[*].resources}{'\n'}"


Wrap up 

When a node runs out of resources and has to evict a pod, it'll evict the pod first that doesn't have explicit resource definitions.
