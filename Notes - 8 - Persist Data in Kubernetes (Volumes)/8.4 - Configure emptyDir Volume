## Configure emptyDir Volume for sidecar 

Log sidecar needs to access the log files 
Each container has its own virtual file system 
Need a shared location each container can access - don't need persisted data 

We need storage that: 
    Storage can be shared 
    Doesn't have to be persistent and permanent 

emptyDir Volume 
    Suitable for multicontainer pods 
    Can be shared among its containers 
    All containers in the pod can read and write the same files in the emptyDir volume 
    emptyDir volume is initially empty 
    Is first created when a pod is assigned to a node and exists as long as that Pod is running on that node 
    When pod is removed from a node, the data is deleted permanently 

Configure emptyDir volume 
    Don't need PV or PVC components 

    On same level as containers of your deployment file - in this example: nginx 
    volumes: 
    - name: log-data 
      emptyDir: {} (only need empty curly braces)
    
    volumeMounts: 
    - name: log-data 
      mountPath: /var/log
      can also grab this portion and add to sidecar container as well - this will allow both containers to access emptyDir

Testing:
    Simulate container writing into log
