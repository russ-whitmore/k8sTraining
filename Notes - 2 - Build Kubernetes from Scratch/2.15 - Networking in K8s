## Networking in kubernetes 

Command: kubectl get node 
    master node status is showing as Notready 

Command: kubectl get pod -n kube-system
    two pods in the kube-system namespace are showing as pending (Coredns pods)

Reason for both issues: 
    Pod network needs to be installed 

What is a pod network?
