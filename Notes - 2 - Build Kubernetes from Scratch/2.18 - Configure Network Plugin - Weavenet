Weave NET

Pod network IP address range should not overlap with the node IP address range 
In AWS we can check the VPC by viewing the private IP address - which in AWS starts with 172. - no overlap 
Weavenet default IP address range starts with 10.32.0.0/12 
There are about a million available IP addresses per cluster with weavenet

Checking Pod Ip addresses
    How do we see the IP addresses of the pods in the cluster
    Detailed output of the pod 
    command - kubectl describe pod (podname) -n (namespace)
        We will see a bunch of output of containers inside the pod 
        You'll see the IP address inside the pod 
        Can't do this for every pod inside the cluster 
    Can display pods output
        Command: kubectl get pod -n kube-system -o wide - will give us an extended output of the pods 
            This will include the IP address   
    Can display node output
        kubectl get node -o wide 

Pod network plugin is a pre-requisite for joining worker nodes
