##Kubernetes Installation

What do we need to install? (On control plane/master and worker)
    1. Container Runtime (run as regular linux process)
    2. Kubelet (run as regular linux process and installed from package repo)
    3. Deploy pods (on control plane mode)
        API Server
        Scheduler
        Controller Manager
        ETCD
    4. Kube Proxy - will run as a pod (installed on both master and worker)
    
2 things to consider
    Kubernetes manifest file for each application
    Deployed securely - no unauthorized access
    Encrypted communication 

Static pods 
    Master components deployed as pods
    Pods are deployed by master components
    Send request to API Server
    Scheduler decides where to place pod
    Pod data stored in etcd store 

How to schedule Master Pods?
    Static Pods
        Are managed directly by Kubelet
        Without control plane 
        Kubelet watches static pod and restarts if fails
        Pod names are suffixed with the node hostname 
        When installing k8s cluster, need to generate static pod manifests 
        Put those config files into correct folder (etc/kubernetes/manifests) where kubelet will find and schedule

Regular Pod scheduling
    API server gets request
    Scheduler decides which node, communicates with kubelet 
    Kubelet schedules node
        Kubelet watches a specific location on the node 
            /etc/Kubernetes/manifests
        Schedules pod when finds a pod manifest 

Certificates 
    Who talks to who?
        Control Plane, API server is the central of communication and every component talks to the API server
        Every component will need to provide a certificate to authenticate itself 
    We need to generate a self-signed CA certificate for Kubernetes (cluster root CA)
    Sign all client and server certificates with it 
    Certificates are stored in /etc/kubernetes/pki 
    Server Certificate for the API server endpoint
    Client certificate for scheduler and controller manager 
    Server certificate for etcd and kubelet 
    Client certificate for API server to talk to Kubelets and Etcd 
    Client certificate for kubelet to authenticate to API server 

PKI certificates for authentication 
    Every client needs to be authorized for API server and Etcd 
    To ensure proper authentication, each component gets a certificate

Client certificates for K8s admins 
    Signed by cluster root CA

1. Generate self-signed CA certificate for whole kubernetes cluster
2. Sign all client and server certificates with it 
    Server Certificate for the API server endpoint
    Client certificate for scheduler and controller manager 
    Server certificate for etcd and kubelet 
    Client certificate for API server to talk to Kubelets and Etcd 
    Client certificate for kubelet to authenticate to API server 

 Complex and time consuming when doing manually 
    kubeadm bootstraps everything above quickly and in the background 
    maintained by kubernetes itself
