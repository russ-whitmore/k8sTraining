## Install kubeadm, kubelet and kubectl

How does kubeadm work?
    Install kubeadm on each node 
    First command is kubeadm init - executed only once on one of the master nodes 
    This turns a regular server into a master node 
    This command orchestrates the entire cluster set up 
    Generates /etc/kubernetes folder
    Generates a self-signed CA to set up identities for each component
    Put generated certificates inside
    Generates static pod manifest files, into /etc/kubernetes/manifests
    Makes all necessary configurations (API server, kubelet, etcd, etc. )
    Kubelet will detect manifest files and start the pods with suffix of hostname

Kubeadm 
    Does not install or manage kubelet 
    Need to install ourselves: starts pods and containers
    Need to install Kubectl ourselves as well 
    Command line tool to initialize cluster, simplifies process of setting up the cluster 

Kubelet 
    Does things like starting pods and containers
    component that runs on all machines in your cluster 

Kubectl
    Command line tool to talk to the cluster 

All 3 are maintained by kubernetes and have the same release versions

#To install all 3 - follow instructions here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/

1. Update the apt package index and install packages needed to use the Kubernetes apt repository:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl

2. Download the Google Cloud public signing key:

    sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg

3. Add the Kubernetes apt repository:

    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

4. Update apt package index, install kubelet, kubeadm and kubectl, and pin their version:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
    sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl (this stops these versions from auto updating)

##Once these are installed, move to worker nodes to install. 

Worker nodes install
    Convert above to a script by following the same steps in 2.8 Notes (Install Container Runtime)

If you want to install a particular version: 
    append this command: sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
    Add the version number after each app i.e. kubelet=1.21.0-00 kubeadm=1.21.0-00 etc. 

Can check all these services to verify - kubelet will fail but be installed because it's waiting
    It's waiting for kubeadm to initialize the cluster
