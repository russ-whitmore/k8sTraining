##Configure K8s nodes 

1. Turn off swap 
    sudo swapoff -a on each server (worker and master)
2. Open various ports on VMs - https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/ports-and-protocols/
    Can only ssh in AWS to start (port 22)
    Master node: 
        1. Apps on master and worker nodes must communicate 
        2. Use security groups under security section of server 
        3. Select edit inbound rules
        4. Open 6443 for k8s API server, used by all (custom tcp type in AWS)
        5. Open 2379-2380, used by etcd server, accessible only from inside the cluster. Give VPC IP address range 
            Always give minimum permissions
        6. 10250, 10257, 10259 for kubelet api, kube-scheduler and kube-controller-manager respectively. 
            Give VPC IP address range only. Only accessible within private network. 
        7. Name launch wizard group to specified group - in this case, master
    Worker node:
        1. Uses different security group, they need to be the same to prevent duplicate work. 
            To change security group, need to edit node in AWS and assign the same group. 
        2. Need to edit inbound rules 
        3. Kubelet API Port 10250 and only inside the VPC address range 
        4. Nodeport Services - 30000-32767 - all accessible
        5. Save and assign group to worker nodes to avoid duplicate work 

3. Host names 
Name our servers a readable name (master, worker1, worker2)
    1. Connect via ssh command - ssh 0i ~/.ssh/k8s-node.pem to all 3 servers 
    2. command - sudo vim /etc/hosts 
    3. Create entries for each node in the file 
    4. Using the private ip address (not the public facing one) which will be in AWS and in the terminal
    5. format - ip address master 
                ip adress worker1
                ip address worker2
    6. These entires need to be on all servers so they can talk to each other. 
    7. Save and quit (:wq)
    8. Assign hostnames to each server as well
        Command - sudo hostnamectl set-hostname (name of server, i.e. master, worker1, etc.)
