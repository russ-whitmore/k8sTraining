## Networking Basics Pre-req

LAN, Switch, Router, WAN, Gateway

Imagine home network where every home device is connected to a network internally
    This is called a LAN
    Defined by an IP address which is unique for each device 

IP - Internet Protocol 
    32 bit value 
    1 bit = 1 or 0 
    Every 8 bits are grouped into an octet 

How do devices talk to each other?
    Switch 
        Sits within the LAN
        Facilitates the connection between all devices in the LAN

How to talk to devices outside of LAN?
    Router 
        Sits between LAN and outside networks (WAN - wide area network)
        Connects devices on LAN and WAN 
        Allowed network devices to access the internet 
    Example: Phone connects to switch which connects to router which connects to the internet 


How to know, whether the other device is inside or outside LAN?
    IP address of target device 
    Devices in the LAN belong to the same IP address range
        Subnet 
    Example: 192.168.0.0 (1)
             255.255.255.0 (2)
        1. Starting point of IP range, first IP in the range 
        2. Sets the IP range 
    If we change the subnet mask from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.0.0
        192.168.x.x - All IP addresses starting with 192.168.x.x belong to the same LAN 
        192.168.0.x - All IP addresses starting with 192.168.1.x belong to the same LAN 
    255.255.0.0 - means that 16 bits are fixed 
    255.255.255.0 - means that 24 bits are fixed 
        Value 255 fixates the octet
        Value 0 means free range 
    
CIDR block 
    Subnet mask dictates how many bits are fixed 
    CIDR - Classless Inter-domain routing 
    Shorthand for IP address and subnet mask:
    Instead of 192.168.0.0 and 255.255.255.0 = 192.168.0.0/24
    Another example: 192.168.0.0 and 255.255.0.0 = 192.168.0.0/16
    16 and 24 represent the number of fixed bits 

Any device needs 3 pieces of data for communication:
    IP address
    Subnet 
    Gateway 

NAT
    IP address range chosen by an administrator 
    Each device gets a unique IP from that range 
    How to make sure IP addresses don't overlap? 
        IP addresses that belong to a LAN, they aren't visible to the internet 
        It's replaced by IP address of Router - NAT 
    NAT is when your local IP address is replaced by the router. 

    Benefits of NAT 
        Security and protection of devices within LAN 
        Reuse IP addresses 
        Two huge companies can have the same internal IP Addresses and there's no impact 
        Limited number of IP addresses available 

Firewall 
   By default a server is not accessible from outside the LAN because of the Firewall
   Set of rules that prevent unauthorized access from entering a private network 
   Using Firewall rules, you can define, which requests are allowed 

   Firewall rules 
    Which IP in your network is accessible
    Which IP can access your server 
    You can allow everyone to talk to it - if you're running an application 

Port 
    Every device has a set of ports
    You can allow specific ports - like a door. Can keep certain doors opened and others locked 
    Like doors to the same building 
    You can unlock for specific guests or IP addresses
    Firewall config defines which server you want to unlock and for which requests 
    Different applications listen on different ports 
        You can access an application on a specific port 
        There are standard ports for many applications  
            i.e. Port 80 - web servers 
        Other apps like databases have standard ports as well 
        Every application needs a port 
        Each port is unique 
            If you have more than 1 application attempting to listen on the same port, you will get an error 
                Error will be port already in use
