## Provisioning infrastructure on AWS

Install and setup k8s cluster on AWS 

1. Login to AWS and create 3 ubuntu servers
    1 Master node and 2 worker nodes
    2 cores and 4 gb for Master
    2 cores and 8 gb for workers
    Name them nodes
2. Set up .ssh folder and copy k8s-node.pem cert over to .ssh folder (will need admin access on local)
    Can create folder if necessary, using ssh-keygen in terminal
3. Will need to adjust permissions on key path first using command: chmod 400 (.ssh key filepath)
4. Once file is copied over, will need to ssh into Master node
    ssh -i (key path) ubuntu@ipaddress - hit enter
5. You will now have access into the server
