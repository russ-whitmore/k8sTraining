    Virtual machines will run in one of those AZs 
    VPC will span in that region 
    In each region, VPC isolates where your virtual servers are compared to other users
    Multiple VPCs in different regions 
    Virtual representation of a network infrastructure 
    Subnet for each availability zone 
    Internal IP address range on a VPC 
    Any new instance will assign a new range, meant for traffic inside VPC to communicate with internal
