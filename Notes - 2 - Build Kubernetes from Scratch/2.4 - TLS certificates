## TLS certificates (Pre-req)

What and why TLS certificates
    A way to establish trust and secure connection
    One party is always initiating the request 
        Client
    Server/application replies to the request 

What does secure communication mean?
    Without unencrypted communication, a user logging in to a bank for example would have plain text username/password
    This would allow a hacker who intercepts the traffic to see those credentials instantly.

How do we prevent that?
    Encrypt the data
    Take a random string to change that into unreadable text
    Encryption key - randomly generated used to encrypt plain text data 
    Symetric Encryption is when you use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data

Asymetric Encryption
    Key pair
    Encrypt with one key and decrypt with another 
    Use that encryption to securely login 
    Server will have a second key to decrypt clients traffic 
    The key that clients have is public and can be shared with anyone 
    The decrypt key or private key must stay private and on the server however

Impersonate servers
    Hackers will try to impersonate the server by making an identical website
    Hacker will act as a real server
    Have it's own keypair 
    Client will establish a secure connection with hacker's server
    To avoid:
        How can client validate the public key?
        Certificates need to get public key signed and certified 
            CA or certificate authority
            Public key is embedded
            Name of website and subdomains 
            Signature of CA

When you access the real website in the browser
    Browser(client) will check for certificate
    Make sure cert is valid 
    Make sure signature is valid 

Server requesting cert from client 
    Client certificates
        Gets signed by trusted CA
        This happens in the background 

Trusted vs Untrusted Certificate authority
    How does the browser know that the CA is legit?
        Official list of all authorized and acknowledged CAs 
        Each modern OS has a list already packaged 
        Browsers are able to verify because of this 
        Browser will recognize CA and give you a warning - this could be hacker generated
            Called self signed certificate 

Process of getting certificate
    Create key-pair
    Generate signing request 
    CA validates information 
    CA signs and issues certificate to you 
    This is called a public key infrastructure or PKI
