##Nodeport 

ClusterIP = internal service
NodePort = external service 

kubectl delete svc nginx-service 

vim nginx-service.yaml - ClusterIP is default in service config file under spec: type:  
    in spec:
        type: NodePort
under ports:
        nodeport has a third port called nodeport - needs to be added as an extra line under ports 

What is a nodeport?

    When we create an internal service from our pod that service is accessible from other pods in our ClusterIP
    When we create a nodeport, it creates an internal service but it also opens ports on each worker node in the cluster to make it accessible from the outside 

    There is a dedicated port range for nodeports
        Going to security groups in AWS 
            We configured a FW rule from 30000 - 32767 
                That's the port range when creating a nodeport - needs to be within the above range 

    Add that port into the config file in the keypair under ports section nodePort: 30000
    Save and quit 

    apply - kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
    now service will show up but be a nodeport as type

Nodeport service is now accessible outside the cluster on IP address of node + node port 
    When request comes in - request will be forwarded to the internal service IP address
