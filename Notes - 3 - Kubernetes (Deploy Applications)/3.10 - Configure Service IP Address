## Configure Service IP address

Where is the service IP address range configured?
    not the same as pod ip addresses 
    verify by kubectl get pod -o wide 

Cluster IP type
    default service type
    Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP
    Service only reachable from within the cluster 

Ip address is defined in the kube api server configuration 
    location: /etc/kubernetes/manifests - 
    sudo vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml 
    service-cluster-ip-range= 10.96.0.0/12 - shows CIDR block in kube-apiserver file 
    Only apps in the cluster can access the services 
    kubeadm provisiones and creates the kubeapi server
    kubeadm init --help 
    Alternative ip address is --service-cidr string 
    The 10.96.0.0 is the default range 
    Can check values by running:
     kubeadm config print init-defaults
    This will show all default values created by kubeadm 
    If you need to change any values after you initialize a cluster 
    Example: change cidr block in kubeapi 
        sudo vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml 
        scroll down to --service-cluster-ip-range= 10.96.0.0/12 section 
        change 10 to 20 
        save and quit the file 
        kubectl get pod -n kube-system
        connection will be refused - apiserver is restarting because of the change 
        After it restarts we can now connect 
        Kube api server will be restarted 
        Services in the cluster before we made the update will be the same - nothing should change
        New CIDR block applies to anything after the change, not before 
    To test that:
        kubectl get service 
        Need to specify type of service 
        ClusterIP is what we'll choose
        kubectl create service clusterip test-new-cidr --tcp=80:80
        Service was created and should now have a new range 
        kubectl get service to verify
