## Connecting to your NGINX pod 

Deploy test pod 
    will curl to nginx from inside that pod 
    no need for a deployment config file 
    create pod with kubectl run 
    kubectl run test-nginx-svc --image=nginx
    kubect get pod - to verify pod was started 

    How to execute commands from inside the pod?
        kubectl exec - lets us execute commands inside the pod 
        kubectl exec -it (it stands for interactive terminal) 
        kubectl exec -it test-nginx-svc -- bash
            getting interactive terminal in order to execute bash commands inside test-nginx-svc pod 
        This is a great way to debug - you'll have root inside the pod 
        exit will leave the pod 
        kubectl get svc
        kubectl exec -it test-nginx-svc -- bash 
        We want to curl the nginx-service from inside the pod 
        To do that: 
            run the exec command above
            curl http://(ipaddress of nginx-service and port (8080))
            curl http://10.98.83.8:8080 - Example 
        You should get output from nginx 
            curl http://nginx-service:8080
                Use the service name to ensure the service name is resolved to the IP address
