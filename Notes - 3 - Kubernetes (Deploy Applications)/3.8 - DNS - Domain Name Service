## Pre-req DNS 

Every computer is uniquely identified by its IP address

Why do we use names instead of IP addresses?
    Is that a serious question? We can't remember all those IP addresses, using a name is way easier. 
    Computers don't so there's a translation service that translates names into numbers - DNS

DNS allows us giving a unique name to any IP address - like a phonebook

Domain names have a heirarchical structure 
    Root domains .
    TLDs or top level domains 
        .edu, .com, .org, .mil, .net, .gov
    There are also domains for each country
You can buy a domain name, i.e. mywebsite.com 

Who manages these names?
    Regulated by internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (ICANN)
        Authorizes domain name registrars 

Fully qualified domain name 
    example: courses.techworld-with-nana.com. - last . is root domain 
    Not necessary to add the ending dot 

Every computer has a DNS client installed
