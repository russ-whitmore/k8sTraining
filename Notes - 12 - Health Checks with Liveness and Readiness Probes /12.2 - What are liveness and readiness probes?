## Liveness and readiness probes - what are they?

Liveness Probe 
    Why is this important?
        K8s manages its resources intelligently 
        Restarts pods when it crashes 
        Pod runs, but application inside is not in a healthy state 
        We need to let k8s know in which state our app is 
        So k8s auto restarts the app 
        Perform health checks with liveness probes 
        Liveness probes automatically restarts the pod if the app isn't running 

    How to configure it?
      under spec section - 3 types of checking the health status 
      1. Exec probes 
        Kubelet executes the specified command to check the health 
        can specify
      2. TCP probes - kubelet makes probe connection at the node, not in the pod 
      3. HTTP probes - kubelet sends and HTTP request to specified path and port 


Readiness probe 
    Why is this important?
        K8s knows the pod state 
        Liveness probe for application state 
        Health checks only after container started 
    What about start up process?
        Pod created successfully 
        Application not starting???
        Perform health checks with readiness probe 
            Lets k8s know if app is ready to receive traffic
            Without readiness probe, k8s assumes the app is ready to receive traffic as soon as container starts
    How to configure it?
        Configuration very similar to liveness probe 
        Both check applications availability
        Readiness probe
            During application startup 
        Liveness probe 
            While application is running
