##Intro to k8s config file 
First 2 lines (apiVersion and kind) are dependent on the type of component being configured 
Made in YAML - very strict about indentations 
YAML online validators can help

3 Parts of a configuration file 
    1. Metadata - name
    2. Specification - put all configurations you want to apply for that component
    3. Status - desired vs actual 
        The information of the current status comes from the ETCD 

Store config files with your code or own git repo just for configuration files
