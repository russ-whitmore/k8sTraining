##Manage kubernetes resources 

Kubectl
    Kubernetes CLI tool
    Can create, delete and update deployment, statefulset etc. 
    Enables interaction with the cluster
    Get information from the cluster
    Limitation when using these commands when trying to configure more complex things. Multiple ports etc. 


Config file (kubernetes configuration files)
    Alternative for more complex configurations 
    Write the entire configuration in a file and once its done you can apply whats in the file with kubectl apply command. 
    Update k8s components - edit config and apply again 
    Delete k8s components with config file 
    Also called kubernetes manifests 

Imperative vs Declarative
    Imperative - telling kubernetes what to do 
        Create, update, delete etc. 
        Can be useful when testing or making quick changes 
    Declarative - we declare what we want in the configuration file then kubernetes figures that out
        Better than Imperative because it ties into infra as code
        More transparent because we can see changes
