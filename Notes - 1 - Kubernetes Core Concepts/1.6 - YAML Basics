##YAML Basics Tutorial 

What is YAML 
    Data serialization language (JSON, YAML, XML)
        Applications written with different technologies can transfer data to each other
    Human readable and intuitive 

YAML compared to others 
    YAML is a superset of JSON: any valid JSON file is a YAML file (without curly brackets)
    Line separation and indentation is how you view different sections 
    Cleanest and most readable format of all 3

Use cases 
    Ansible, kubernetes, docker compose, prometheus etc. 

Syntax of YAML
    Key-value pairs (example below) 
        # comment here 
        app: user-authentication
        port: 9000
        version: 1.7
    Object 
        indenting key value pairs and enclosing it in an object. (example below with microservice as the name of the object)
        microservice: 
            app: user-authentication
            port: 9000
            version: 1.7
    Lists - multiple objects (example below)
        Can use lists inside of lists
        List items need to be aligned
        Always need to start with dashes as below  
         microservices: 
          - app: user-authentication
            port: 9000
            version: 1.7
          - app: shopping cart 
            port: 9002
            version: 1.9
    Boolean
        microservices: 
          - app: user-authentication
            port: 9000
            version: 1.7
            deployed: off (boolean values, yes or no, on or off, etc.)
    Environmental Variables 
        Can access them using a dollar sign and the name like a normal variable
    Multiple Components
        Can be separated using 3 dashes --- 
        Is used if you need multiple configurations and need to separate them out.
