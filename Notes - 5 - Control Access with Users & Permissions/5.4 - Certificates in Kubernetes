##Certificates in kubernetes

Client Certificates in k8s 
    kubeadm init generates all needed certs for k8s components
    stored in /etc/kubernetes/pki 
    server certificates are stored in there 
    etcd certs are stored /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd

Who signed those certificates?
    Kubeadmin generated a CA for k8s cluster 
    etcd-ca and kubernetes-ca

Why are they trusting a auto-generated CA?
    All clients got a copy of the k8s ca that's signed the API server certificate in the kube-config files 
    Just like OS has a list, we add a new CA to the list of the client 
    K8s CA are trusted within k8s by all components who have a copy of it
